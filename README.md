<h1>RizzFacialDetection</h1>
<p>This repository holds the code for a fun, image recognition project named RizzFacialDetection. While not intended for serious applications, it explores the idea of using facial recognition to assign a "rizz score."</p>
<h3>What it Does (for Fun):</h3>
<ol>Detects Faces: The program open a build in webcam that will identify human faces within it.</ol>
<ol>Recognize Face: The first 200 frames from the webcam camera will be use to train a model to recognize that certain face and locked it in.</ol>
<ol>Rizz Score: Based on some facial features, the program assigns a lighthearted "rizz score" to each detected face. Higher scores imply...well, you get the idea!</ol>
<h3>Important Note:</h3>
<p>This project is purely for entertainment purposes. Facial features are not a definitive measure of attractiveness, and "rizz" is entirely subjective. So have a laugh as the program assigns its (fictitious) rizz scores!</p>

<p>Feel free to contribute or fork the project to add your own twist to the "rizz score" detection!</p>
